title: Preliminary Committee Meeting - Slides and Notes
---
Today was my first ever committee meeting.  I presented a quick (~20 minute) Keynote presentation, then we discussed problems, concerns, potential areas of exploration, etc. for the rest.

## The Outcome ##

I originally had the following potential areas of exploration:

 * Backend algorithms
 * Concurrency and scalability
 * UI design

After discussing the above options with my committee, I decided that focusing on the UI design would by more difficult than previously thought.  Measuring effectiveness of a UI is difficult and requires random test subjects.  These user studies would require approval from the [UOIT research ethics committee](http://www.uoit.ca/EN/main2/about/14057/14152/Academic_Policies_and_Procedures/research_ethics.html), making them cumbersome to schedule and slowing progress to a crawl.

The focus will thus likely be on backend algorithms, as well as techniques for making the proposed algorithms scale.

I have also learned that Ken loves demos.
