## Outline ##

I intend to write all backend code in [Clojure](http://clojure.org/), using [Cake](http://clojure-cake.org/) as the build tool.  The frontend is to be written entirely in HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript (making use of [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) and other libraries).  [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/) may be used in certain places to automate tasks.

The infrastructure will likely consist of some relational data store (PostgreSQL, SQLite, etc.), and a full-text search engine (most likely Lucene).  This is, of course, subject to change.

The source code will be stored in a [Git](http://git-scm.org/) repository and hosted on [GitHub](http://github.com/).  I intend to edit all of the code in the [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com/) editor.  Development will take place on either OS X or Linux, with the possibility of Windows being added at a later date.  This fulfills my desire to utilize a simple text editor combined with the command line.  Cake allows me to automate many of the compilation, running, testing, and deployment aspects.  Git allows me worry-free development.  By making use of these simple yet powerful tools I will have a complete grasp of exactly what is going on, hopefully making it simpler to debug.

## Plan of Action ##

As per agreement with my supervisor, intend to provide a summary of work performed every week, posted by each Friday evening or early Saturday morning.  It will summarize readings I have done, any thoughts towards the project, and a brief or detailed (depending on time constraints) report on the progress made.

### Committee Meeting ###

I have a committee meeting scheduled towards the end of October 2011 to prepare for.  This will involve some sort of demo of what has been done so far, as well as a presentation outlining essentially what is posted here in the weeks preceeding the meeting.

The presentation will cover some of the following topics:

* Motivation for choosing this problem
* Possible challenges that will be faced in solving the problem
* (Optional) cover previous work done in this area
* The method in which I intend to solve the problem
  * Tools, technologies, etc. I will be using to assist me
	* Possible resources I can tap into
* What I hope to accomplish by doing all of this
